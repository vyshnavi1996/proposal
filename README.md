# proposal for the Class Remainder App

- We are planning to develop this app using technologies based on c# with DotNet and Angular as front-end.
- As C# is brought up by Microsoft, it is most popularly used for the development of Windows desktop applications. 
- Angular is an open-source JavaScript framework most suited to develop this application.
